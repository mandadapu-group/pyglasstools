# PyGlassTools

PyGlassTools is a Python module that compiles a couple of calculations that I routinely do when analyzing atomistic trajectories, particularly supercooled liquids and glasses.

This is a (highly) experimental version for development purposes. **Do not git pull/clone** unless you are confident with what you're doing! Current development in place is to construct a C++ backend that is also highly efficient
