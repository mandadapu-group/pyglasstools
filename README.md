# PyGlassTools

PyGlassTools is a Python module that compiles a couple of calculations that I routinely do when analyzing atomistic trajectories, particularly supercooled liquids and glasses.

FLexibility is important as I deal not just with one type of potential energy function, but multiple kinds that represent various glass-forming liquids.

Supported calculations include the following:
- Local Irving-Kirkwood stress calculations given an arbitrary pair potential.
- Autocorrelation functions such as the intermediate scattering function and stress autocorrelation functions.
- (Coming Soon) Normal mode analysis & local elasticity constant calculations.

More documentation will come soon!

To install:

```console
$ cd /path/to/pyglasstools/
$ python -m pip install .
```
